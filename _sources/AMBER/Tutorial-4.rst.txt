This tutorial shows how to use the SIRAH force field to perform a coarse grained (CG) simulation of a
closed circular DNA using the Generalized Born model (GB) for implicit solvent.

The main references for this tutorial are: `Dans et al. <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct900653p>`_ (latest parameters are those reported `here <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct100379f>`_) and `Machado & Pantano <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1568/1743152>`_. We strongly advise you to read these articles before starting the tutorial.

    Check the :ref:`Setting up SIRAH <download amber>` section for download and set up details before starting this tutorial.

4.1. Build CG representations
______________________________

Map the atomistic structure of the closed circular DNA to its CG representation:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   ./sirah.amber/tools/CGCONV/cgconv.pl -i ./sirah.amber/tutorial/4/ccdna.pdb | sed -e 's/DCX A   1/CW5 A   1/'  -e 's/DCX B   1/CW5 B   1/' -e 's/DGX A 100/GW3 A 100/' -e 's/DGX B 100/GW3 B 100/' > ccdna_cg.pdb

.. note::

	The 5' and 3' end residues must be renamed to AW5, TW5, GW5 or CW5 and AW3, TW3, GW3 or CW3 to represent the corresponding Adenine, Thymine, Guanine or Cytosine extremes in a closed circular DNA.

The input file ``-i`` ccdna.pdb contains all the heavy atoms composing the DNA molecule, while the output ``-o`` ccdna_cg.pdb preserves a few of them.

.. tip::

	This is the basic usage of the script **cgconv.pl**, you can learn other capabilities from its help by typing:

	.. code-block:: bash

		./sirah.amber/tools/CGCONV/cgconv.pl -h	
		
Please check both PDB structures using VMD:

.. code-block:: bash

	vmd -m ./sirah.amber/tutorial/4/ccdna.pdb ccdna_cg.pdb

From now on it is just normal AMBER stuff!

4.2. Prepare LEaP input
________________________

Use a text editor to create the file ``gensystem.leap`` including the following lines:

.. code-block:: console

	# Load SIRAH force field
	addPath ./sirah.amber
	source leaprc.sirah

	# Load model
	dna = loadpdb ccdna_cg.pdb

	# Make a covalently closed circular DNA
	bond dna.1.PX dna.100.C1X
	bond dna.101.PX dna.200.C1X

	# Save Parms
	saveAmberParmNetcdf dna ccdna_cg.prmtop ccdna_cg.ncrst

	# EXIT
	quit

4.3. Run LEaP
______________

Run the LEaP application to generate the molecular topology and initial coordinate files:

.. code-block:: bash

    tleap -f gensystem.leap

.. note::

    Warning messages about long, triangular or square bonds in ``leap.log`` file are fine and
    expected due to the CG topology of some residues.

This should create a topology file ``ccdna_cg.prmtop`` and a coordinate file ``ccdna_cg.ncrst``.

Use VMD to check how the CG model looks like:

.. code-block::

	vmd ccdna_cg.prmtop ccdna_cg.ncrst -e ./sirah.amber/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl


.. tip::

    VMD assigns default radius to unknown atom types, the script ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` sets the right
    ones, according to the CG representation. It also provides a kit of useful selection macros, coloring methods and backmapping utilities.
    Use the command ``sirah_help`` in the Tcl/Tk console of VMD to access the manual pages. To learn about SIRAH Tools' capabilities, you can also go to the :ref:`SIRAH Tools tutorial <SIRAH tools>`.

4.4. Run the simulation
________________________

Make a new folder for the run:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p run; cd run

The folder ``sirah.amber/tutorial/4/GPU`` contains typical input files for energy minimization (``em_GBSA.in``), equilibration (``eq_GBSA.in``) and production (``md_GBSA.in``) runs. Please check carefully the input flags therein.

.. tip::

    **Some commonly used flags in AMBER**

   - ``-i``: Input file.
   - ``-o``: Output file.
   - ``-p``: Parameter/topology file.
   - ``-c``: Coordinate file.
   - ``-r``: Restart file.
   - ``-x``: Trajectory file.

.. caution::

    These input files are executed by the **GPU** implementation of ``pmemd.cuda``. Other available modules are ``sander``  or ``pmemd``, which are both **CPU** implementations of Amber.

.. note::

       You can find example input files for CPU versions of ``sander`` and ``pmemd`` at folder ``CPU/``, within ``sirah.amber/tutorial/4/``


**Energy Minimization:**

.. code-block:: bash

	pmemd.cuda -O -i ../sirah.amber/tutorial/4/GPU/em_GBSA.in -p ../ccdna_cg.prmtop -c ../ccdna_cg.ncrst -o ccdna_cg_em.out -r ccdna_cg_em.ncrst &

**Equilibration:**

.. code-block:: bash

	pmemd.cuda -O -i ../sirah.amber/tutorial/4/GPU/eq_GBSA.in -p ../ccdna_cg.prmtop -c ccdna_cg_em.ncrst -o ccdna_cg_eq.out -r ccdna_cg_eq.ncrst -x ccdna_cg_eq.nc &

**Production (100ns):**

.. code-block:: bash

	pmemd.cuda -O -i ../sirah.amber/tutorial/4/GPU/md_GBSA.in -p ../ccdna_cg.prmtop -c ccdna_cg_eq.ncrst -o ccdna_cg_md.out -r ccdna_cg_md.ncrst -x ccdna_cg_md.nc &


4.5. Visualizing the simulation
________________________________

Thatâ€™s it! Now you can load, visualize and analize the trajectory file in VMD:

.. code-block::

	vmd ../ccdna_cg.prmtop ../ccdna_cg.ncrst ccdna_cg_md.nc -e ../sirah.amber/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl

.. note::

    The file ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` is a Tcl script that is part of SIRAH Tools and contains the macros to properly visualize the coarse-grained structures in VMD. Use the command ``sirah-help`` in the Tcl/Tk console of VMD to access the manual pages. To learn about SIRAH Tools' capabilities, you can also go to the :ref:`SIRAH Tools tutorial <SIRAH tools>`.

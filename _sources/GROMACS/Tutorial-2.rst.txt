This tutorial shows how to apply the hybrid solvation approach of SIRAH force field to speed up the simulation of an atomistic solute. The example system contains a DNA fiber surrounded by a shell of atomistic waters, which are embedded in coarse-grained (CG) molecules, called WT4, to represent
bulk water. The general procedure is extensible to any other solute. The hybrid solvation methodology is well tested for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P atomistic water models. The main references for this tutorial are: `WAT4 <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct100379f>`_, `All-atoms/CG solvation <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct3001816>`_, `Transferable All-atoms/CG solvation <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp4079579>`, and `SIRAH Tools <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1568/1743152>`_. We strongly advise you to read these articles before starting the tutorial.

2.1. PDB to GROMACS format
__________________________

Use pdb2gmx to convert the PDB file of the solute ``dna.pdb`` into GROMACS format: 

.. code-block:: bash

	gmx pdb2gmx -f sirah.ff/tutorial/2/dna.pdb -o dna.gro

.. caution::
	
	In GROMACS versions prior to 5.x, the "gmx" command should not be used.
	
When prompted, choose *AMBER99SB* and then *TIP3P* as water model.




.. caution::

	Getting warning messages of long bonds is fine and expected due to the CG nature of the
	residue topologies. However missing atom messages are errors which probably trace back to the
	mapping step. In that case, check your atomistic and mapped structures and do not carry on the
	simulation until the problem is solved.

.. note::

	Merging both DNA chains is convenient when planning to apply restraints between them.


During long simulations of DNA, capping residues may eventually separate. If you want to avoid this
effect, which is called helix fraying, add Watson-Crick (WC) restraints at terminal base pairs. To add
these restraints edit ``topol.top`` to include the file ``WC_RST.itp`` at the end of the [ moleculetype ] section:

.. list-table::
   :align: center
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Topology without WC restraints
     - Topology with WC restraints
   * - | ; Include Position restraint file
       | #ifdef POSRES
       | #include "posre.itp"
       | #endif
       
     - | ; Include Position restraint file
       | #ifdef POSRES
       | #include "posre.itp"
       | #endif
       | ; Watson-Crick restraints
       | #include "./sirah.ff/tutorial/1/WC_RST.itp"


1.3. Solvate the system
_______________________


Define the simulation box of the system

.. code-block:: bash 
	
	gmx editconf -f dna_cg.gro -o dna_cg_box.gro -bt octahedron -d 2 -c

Add WT4 molecules:

.. code-block:: bash 

	gmx solvate -cp dna_cg_box.gro -cs sirah.ff/wt416.gro -o dna_cg_sol.gro

.. note:: 

	In GROMACS in versions earlier than 5.x the command  *gmx solvate* was named to *genbox*.

Edit the [ molecules ] section in ``topol.top`` to include the number of added WT4 molecules:

	
.. hint::
	
	If you forget to read the number of added WT4 molecules from the output of *solvate*, then use the following command line to get it 

	.. code-block:: console

		grep -c WP1 dna_cg_sol.gro

.. list-table::
   :align: center
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Topology before editing
     - Topology after editing
   * - | [ molecules ]
       | ; Compound #mols
       | DNA_chain_A 1
              
     - | [ molecules ]
       | ; Compound #mols
       | DNA_chain_A 1
       | WT4 3179

.. caution::
	
	The number of added WT4 molecules **3179** may change according to the software version.

Add CG counterions and 0.15M NaCl:

.. code-block:: bash

	gmx grompp -f sirah.ff/tutorial/1/CPU/em_CGDNA.mdp -p topol.top -c dna_cg_sol.gro -o dna_cg_sol.tpr

.. code-block:: bash

	gmx genion -s dna_cg_sol.tpr -o dna_cg_ion.gro -np 113 -pname NaW -nn 75 -nname ClW


When prompted, choose to substitute WT4 molecules by ions.

.. note:: 

	The available ionic species in SIRAH force field are: ``Na⁺`` (NaW), ``K⁺`` (KW) and ``Cl⁻`` (ClW). One
	ion pair (e.g. NaW-ClW) each 34 WT4 molecules renders a salt concentration of ~0.15M (see :ref:`Appendix <Appendix>` for details). 
	Counterions were added according to `Machado et al. <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00953>`_.

Edit the [ molecules ] section in ``topol.top`` to include the CG ions and the correct number of WT4.

Before running the simulation it may be a good idea to visualize your molecular system. CG molecules
are not recognized by molecular visualizers and will not display correctly. To fix this problem you may
generate a PSF file of the system using the script *g_top2psf.pl*:

.. code-block:: bash

	./sirah.ff/tools/g_top2psf.pl -i topol.top -o dna_cg_ion.psf

.. note::

	This is the basic usage of the script ``g_top2psf.pl``, you can learn other capabilities from its help:
	``./sirah.ff/tools/g_top2psf.pl -h``


Use VMD to check how the CG system looks like:

.. code-block::

	vmd dna_cg_ion.psf dna_cg_ion.gro -e sirah.ff/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl

.. note::

	VMD assigns default radius to unknown atom types, the script sirah_vmdtk.tcl sets the right
	ones. It also provides a kit of useful selection macros, coloring methods and a backmapping utility.
	Use the command sirah_help in the Tcl/Tk console of VMD to access the manual pages.

1.4. Run the simulation
________________________

.. important:: 

	By default in this tutorial we will use input files for GROMACS on GPU (``sirah.ff/tutorial/1/GPU``). Example input files for using GROMACS on CPU can be found at: ``sirah.ff/tutorial/1/CPU``.

The folder ``sirah.ff/tutorial/1/GPU/`` contains typical input files for energy minimization
(``em_CGDNA.mdp``), equilibration (``eq_CGDNA.mdp``) and production (``md_CGDNA.mdp``) runs. Please
check carefully the input flags therein.

Create an index file:

.. code-block:: bash

	echo "q" | make_ndx -f dna_cg_ion.gro -o dna_cg_ion.ndx

.. note::

	WT4 and CG ions (NaW and ClW) are automatically set to the group “SIRAH-Solvent”.

Make a new folder for the run:

.. code-block:: bash

	mkdir run; cd run

Energy Minimization:

.. code-block:: bash

	gmx grompp -f ../sirah.ff/tutorial/1/GPU/em_CGDNA.mdp -p ../topol.top -po em.mdp -n ../dna_cg_ion.ndx -c ../dna_cg_ion.gro -o dna_cg_em.tpr mdrun -deffnm dna_cg_em &> EM.log &

Equilibration:

.. code-block:: bash 

	grompp -f ../sirah.ff/tutorial/1/GPU/eq_CGDNA.mdp -p ../topol.top -po eq.mdp -n ../dna_cg_ion.ndx -c dna_cg_em.gro -o dna_cg_eq.tpr mdrun -deffnm dna_cg_eq &> EQ.log &

Production (100ns):

.. code-block:: bash

	gmx grompp -f ../sirah.ff/tutorial/1/GPU/md_CGDNA.mdp -p ../topol.top -po md.mdp -n ../dna_cg_ion.ndx -c dna_cg_eq.gro -o dna_cg_md.tpr mdrun -deffnm dna_cg_md &> MD.log &

.. note::

	GPU flags were set for GROMACS 4.6.7, different versions may complain about some specifications.

1.5. Visualizing the simulation
________________________________

That’s it! Now you can analyze the trajectory.

Process the output trajectory at folder run/ to account for the Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC):

.. code-block:: bash

	gmx trjconv -s dna_cg_em.tpr -f dna_cg_md.xtc -o dna_cg_md_pbc.xtc -n ../dna_cg_ion.ndx -ur compact -center -pbc mol

When prompted, choose *DNA* for centering and *System* for output.

Now you can check the simulation using VMD:

.. code-block:: bash

	vmd ../dna_cg_ion.psf ../dna_cg_ion.gro dna_cg_md_pbc.xtc -e ../sirah.ff/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl

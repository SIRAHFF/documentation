About SIRAH
===========

`SIRAH <http://www.sirahff.com/>`_ is a coarse-grained force field for molecular dynamics simulations that offers plug-and-play topologies and parameters for aqueous solvent, phospholipids, DNA, metal ions, and proteins. It was designed, implemented, and developed by the `Biomolecular Simulations Group <https://pasteur.uy/laboratorios/simulaciones-biomoleculares/)>`_ at the `Institut Pasteur de Montevideo <https://pasteur.uy/>`_, Uruguay, which is also responsible for its regular maintenance.  

The current version, **SIRAH 2.2**, includes:   

* A series of modifications to both bonded and non-bonded parameters of amino acids while preserving their original topologies;       

* A description of different protonation states and post-translational modifications for protein residues;       

* An improvement in the compatibility for mapping different force fields atom types and experimental structures;      

* The ability to leverage GPU acceleration in AMBER and GROMACS codes;     

* A collection of scripts, known as **SIRAH Tools**, that facilitate the process of mapping all-atom files to CG representations, backmapping, visualizing, and analyzing SIRAH trajectories directly on the popular VMD program for molecular visualization.

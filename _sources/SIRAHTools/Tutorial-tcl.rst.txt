This tutorial shows how to visualize and analize trajectory files using the **SIRAH Tools** plugin for VMD. The main reference
for this tutorial is `Machado & Pantano <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1568/1743152>`_. The protein−DNA complex used here is the 3′ Repair Exonuclease 1 (TREX 1, PDB id: `5YWS <https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5YWS>`_) and its simulation was previously dicussed by `Klein et al. <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00160>`_. We strongly advise you to read these articles before starting the tutorial.

.. warning::

    This tutorial requires the use of **VMD** and **AmberTools**. Install these applications if you do not already have them. If you need to install any of these applications, visit the following websites for installation instructions and additional information: `Install AmberTools <https://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php#ambertools>`_ and `VMD installation guide <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/ig/node6.html>`_.


.. important::

    In this tutorial, we will focus on the ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` plugin. The utilization of the SIRAH Tools scripts ``cgconv.pl`` to map AA to CG, and ``g_top2psf.pl`` to convert GROMACS' topologies to PSF files, is covered elsewhere in the documentation. We recommend that you review the other tutorial sections.



Visualization of CG systems
----------------------------

One of the features of the SIRAH Tools plugin for VMD, ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl``, is that it improves the visualization and analysis of SIRAH's CG trajectories. This plugin sets the correct van der Waals radii, sets the correct coloring code by atom and residue types, and has macros for selecting molecular components on SIRAH trajectories.

After processing the output trajectory to account for the Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) (see :ref:`Amber <AMBER>`, :ref:`GROMACS <GROMACS>` or :ref:`NAMD <NAMD>` tutorials for examples of how you can do this), load the processed trajectory and the ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` file in VMD:

.. code-block:: bash

    vmd ../5YWS_cg.psf 5YWS_cg_md_pbc.xtc -e ../sirah.ff/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl

.. tip::
	
   You can also load ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` inside VMD. Go to *Extensions* > *Tk Console* and enter:
   
   **For AMBER**

   .. code-block:: bash

      source ../sirah.amber/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl
   
   **For GROMACS**
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      source ../sirah.ff/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl


With the ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` file loaded, you can access the ``sirah_help`` feature by going to *Extensions* > *Tk Console* and entering 

.. code-block:: console

   sirah_help 

The output will be the following:

.. code-block:: console
	
	>>>> sirah_help <<<<

	Manual version: 1.1 \[Mar 2019\]

	Description:

		Command to access the User Manual pages of SIRAH Tools

	Usage: sirah_help CommandName

	CommandName       Function
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
		sirah_ss        Calculate secondary structure in SIRAH proteins
		sirah_backmap   Backmap coarse-grained to atomistic systems
		sirah_restype   Set SIRAH residue types
		sirah_radii     Set SIRAH vdW radii
		sirah_macros    Set useful selection macros
		sirah_help      Access User Manual pages
	-----------------------------------------------------------------

		
If ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` is not loaded in VMD, the trajectory will still be loaded, but the correct bead sizes, residue types, charges, etc. will not be generated (see **Figure 1**).

SIRAH macros
_____________

In VMD, a macro is a text that represents a selection. Macros are a useful feature of VMD when you use certain selections often. In the SIRAH Tools plugin for VMD, ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl``, 10 macros are available:

* ``sirah_membrane`` - select only lipid residues;
* ``sirah_nucleic`` - select only acid nucleic residues;
* ``sirah_protein`` - select only protein residues;
* ``sirah_basic`` - select only basic amino acid residues;
* ``sirah_acidic`` - select only acidic amino acid residues;
* ``sirah_polar`` - select only polar amino acid residues;
* ``sirah_neutral`` - select only neutral amino acid residues;
* ``sirah_backbone`` - select the backbone beads of protein (GN, GC, and GO) and acid nucleic (PX, C5X, and O3');
* ``sirah_water`` - select all solvent available in the force field (WT4 and WLS);
* ``sirah_ions`` - select all ions available in the force field (KW, NaW, ClW, MgX, CaX, and ZnX). 

To use any SIRAH macro, go to *Graphics* > *Representations* (See **Figure 2**) and click on the *Create Rep* button. In the *Selected Atoms* box, erase the text that appears there and type any of the available macros above.

.. figure:: /../images/sirah_tools_2.png

   :width: 100%

   **Figure 2.** Our trajectory loaded in VMD with the default representation and without any selection.
   
.. tip::
	 To see all available VMD's *Singlewords*, click on the *Selections* tab in the *Graphics* > *Representations* window and look through the *Singlewords* panel. You can also double-click on a singleword, and then, click on the *Apply* button to use a VMD Macro.
	
Since our system is a protein−DNA complex with coordinating magnesium ions, you can use four macros: ``sirah_protein`` (see **Figure 3A**), ``sirah_nucleic`` (see **Figure 3B**), ``sirah_water`` (see **Figure 3C**), and ``sirah_ions`` (see **Figure 3D**).

.. figure:: /../images/sirah_tools_3.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

   **Figure 3.** Each of the macros of our systems shown as a single image. A) The ``sirah_protein`` macro using *Licorice* as *Drawing Method*. The backbone beads of the protein are pink, and the sidechains ones are blue when using the *Coloring Method* Name. B) The ``sirah_nucleic`` macro using the *Licorice* as *Drawing Method*. For the DNA, the backbone beads PX, C5X, and O3' are colored dark yellow, cyan, and red, respectively, and the sidechain ones are colored red and blue using the *Coloring Method* Name. C) The ``sirah_water`` macro using the *CPK* as *Drawing Method*. In this system, only WT4 was used and is colored green by the *Coloring Method* Name. D) The ``sirah_ions`` macro using the *VDW* as *Drawing Method*. The ClW, NaW, and MgW ions are colored cyan, blue, and purple, respectively, when using the *Coloring Method* Name.


To use all representations together, just create different representations for each one (clicking on the *Create Rep* button in the *Graphics* > *Representations* window). Your protein-DNA complex should now look similar to the one in **Figure 4**.

   **Figure 4.** Our protein-DNA complex after using the SIRAH macros ``sirah_backbone``, ``sirah_water``, and ``sirah_ions``. To improve visualization, we used Licorice as *Drawing Method* for ``sirah_backbone`` and CPK for ``sirah_water`` and ``sirah_ions``. In addition, the *Material* of the water beads was changed to Ghost and we hid some elements of the system.
   
.. tip:: 

	As you can see, macros can be very useful and when saving your work in a saved state (*File* > *Save Visualization State*), macros are included in the saved state file to be used later (*File* > *Load Visualization State*).


Structural analysis of CG systems
-----------------------------------

Besides the features that enhance the visualization of SIRAH CG simulations, two additional SIRAH Tools features can be used to analyze the trajectory: ``sirah_ss`` and ``sirah_backmap``. They will be discussed below.


Secondary structure analysis
_____________________________

The utility ``sirah_ss`` assigns secondary structures to CG proteins in SIRAH, classifying residues into *α-helix (H)*, *extended β-sheet (E)* or, otherwise, *coil (C)* conformations, based on the instantaneous values of the backbone’s torsional angles and Hydrogen bond-like (HB) interactions (see `Machado & Pantano <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1568/1743152>`_ for more information). The ``sirah_ss`` feature produces ASCII files of average and by-frame results, which can be visualized as color plots using the python script ``plot_ss.py``.

With the ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` file loaded, you can access the ``sirah_help`` feature by going to *Extensions* > *Tk Console* and entering 

.. code-block:: console

   sirah_help 

to see all the SIRAH tools available options. Or, you can go straight to the help for the ``sirah_ss`` feature by typing

.. code-block:: console

   sirah_ss help

The output will be the following:

.. code-block:: console

      >>>> sirah_ss <<<<

      version: 1.1 [Dec 2015]

      Description:

        Command to calculate the secondary structure of SIRAH proteins.
        
        If mol is omitted then all options are applied to top molecule.
        By default, the secondary structure data is stored in memory
        as the array sscache_data(mol,frame) and the coloring method
        'Secondary Structure' will display correctly. By default, the
        script reads the sscache_data if available in memory and does
        not recalculate the conformation, unless flag ramach is set or
        the sscache_data is cleaned. The outname and noprint keywords
        control the generated output files.

        The current command version does not support PBC options.

      Usage: sirah_ss [options]

      Options: These are the optional arguments

        mol       Set the molecule ID, default top
        
        first     First frame to analyze
        
        last      Last frame to analyze
        
        sel       "VMD selection", default "all"
        
        outname   List {} of keywords and names for output files.
                  Keywords and default names:
                  
                    byframe   ss_by_frame.xvg
                    byres     ss_by_res.xvg
                    global    ss_global.xvg
                    mtx       ss.mtx
                    phi       phi.mtx
                    psi       psi.mtx
        
        load      Load secondary structure data from file (e.g ss.mtx) into molecule (mol)
        
        noprint   Flag to avoid printing standard results to out files
        
        ramach    Flag to write phi and psi angles of residue selection (sel) to out files
        
        nocahe    Flag to avoid saving data to sscache_data
        
        now       Flag to calculate the secondary structure at current frame.
                  No sscache_data or output file is saved.
        
        clean     Flag to clean the sscache_data of the selected molecule (mol) and exit
        
        help      Display help and exit


      Examples:

        1.        Load secondary structure data into molecules 2 and extend the calculation
                  sirah_ss mol 2 load ss.mtx
                  sirah_ss mol 2

        2.        Set custom output file names
                  sirah_ss outname {mtx myss.mtx byframe myss_by_frame.xvg}


All the available options for ``sirah_ss`` are documented in this help. By default, four outputs are created by ``sirah_ss``: ``ss_by_frame.xvg``, ``ss_by_res.xvg``, ``ss_global.xvg`` and ``ss.mtx``. The ``ss_by_frame.xvg`` file gives the secondary structure percentages of the three classifications (H, E, or C) by each frame of the simulations. The ``ss_by_res.xvg`` file gives the secondary structure percentages of H, E, and C by each residue. The ``ss_global.xvg`` file shows the overall percentages and standard deviation of H, E, and C of the entire simulation. And the ``ss.mtx`` file gives a matrix of the secondary structure transitions, between H, E, or C, of the residues versus the simulation time.

You can also choose which molecule and which frames to analyze. To calculate the secondary structure for the protein (loaded on *top*) on all frames, for instance, you must modify the default ``sirah_ss`` selection from *all* to *sirah_protein*. To achieve this, you can enter: 

.. code-block:: console

		sirah_ss sel "sirah_protein"

This will, by default, calculate the secondary structure for all frames of the trajectory of our selection and generate the four files.

Furthermore, we have prepared a python script ``plot_ss.py`` that can be used to plot three of the four files (``ss_by_frame.xvg``, ``ss_by_res.xvg`` and ``ss.mtx``). 

.. important:: 

   The ``plot_ss.py`` script works properly with **Python 3.9**. You can for example create a conda environment using: 

   .. code-block:: console

      conda create --name plot_ss python=3.9

   and activate it using:

   .. code-block:: console

      conda activate plot_ss

   Finally check de python version:

   .. code-block:: console

      python --version

Once you know you are using the right version of Python, you can use the ``plot_ss.py`` script by typing:

.. code-block:: python

   python ../sirah.ff/tools/plot_ss.py -h
   
or

.. code-block:: python

   python ../sirah.amber/tools/plot_ss.py -h

This will show us the options you have within the script, most of the flags are for changing the appearance of the graph (colors, font size, label size, etc). 

.. code-block:: console

   Create a PNG image from an input file (ss.mtx, ss_by_frame.xvg, or ss_by_res.xvg) generated by SIRAH.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
     -i [input]            Input file name (ss.mtx, ss_by_frame.xvg, ss_by_res.xvg)
     -d [dpi]              DPI (dots per inch) for saving the figure (default: 300)
     -tu [tu]              Time unit (us or ns) (default: us)
     -dt [dt]              Time between consecutive frames (default: 1e-04)
     -H [helix-color]      Alpha-helix color (default: darkviolet)
     -E [beta-sheet color] Beta-sheet color (default: yellow)
     -C [coil color]       Coil color (default: aqua)
     -o [out name]         Image output name (default: input name)
     -wt [width]           Image width (inches) (default: 10)
     -ht [height]          Image height (inches) (default: 8)
     -xfs [xlab fontsize]  Fontsize for x-axis labels (default: 14)
     -yfs [ylab fontsize]  Fontsize for y-axis labels (default: 14)
     -yticks [y # ticks]   Number of major tick locators on the y-axis (default: 10)
     -xticks [x # ticks]   Number of major tick locators on the x-axis (default: 10)
     -xtsize [xtsize]      Size of ticks on the x-axis (default: 12)
     -ytsize [ytsize]      Size of ticks on the y-axis (default: 12)
     -title [title]        Title of the plot (default: None)
     -ttsize [title_size]  Size of the plot title (default: 16)
     --version             Print version and exit

The basic use of the script is: 

.. code-block:: console

   python ../sirah.ff/tools/plot_ss.py -i filename 
   
or

.. code-block:: console

   python ../sirah.amber/tools/plot_ss.py -i filename 

where ``filename`` is one of the files ``ss_by_res.xvg``, ``ss_by_frame.xvg`` or ``ss.mtx``.

In the case of the ``ss.mtx`` matrix it may take some time (no more than a couple of minutes), so be patient. 

.. tip::

   To use the flags that modify the colors, any of the following entries is valid. For example, if you would like to use red as the color for the α-helix, you can type:

   ``-H red``
   ``-H r``
   ``-H "red"``
   ``-H "r"``
   ``-H "#FF0000"``

   In the case of HEX code usage, quotation marks are required.

The script generates the plots shown in **Figure 5**, remember that you must plot one by one, selecting the filename according to your interest.

   :width: 100%

   **Figure 5.** Outcomes of ``plot_ss.py`` where the secondary structural elements α-helix (H), extended β-sheet (E), and coil (C) are colored purple, yellow, and blue, respectively. A) The ``ss.mtx`` matrix plot shows the protein's secondary structure transitions during the 3.0 μs MD simulation. B)  The ``ss_by_frame.xvg`` plot shows the three secondary structure elements (H, E, and C) percentages by each frame of the 3.0 μs MD simulation. C) The ``ss_by_res.xvg`` plot shows the three secondary structure elements (H, E, and C) percentages by each residue during the 3.0 μs MD simulation. Here, we put the three plots together and edited the figure to use only one legend. However, the script makes three separate plots, each with its own legend.

.. note::
	
	The files ``ss_by_res.xvg``, ``ss_by_frame.xvg``, and ``ss.mtx`` can also be plotted using other plotting programs such as `Grace <https://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/>`_ or `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_. In addition, the ``plot_ss.py`` script can be modified or improved according to the necessity of the user.



Backmapping analysis
_____________________

The utility ``sirah_backmap`` initially retrieves pseudo-atomistic information from the CG model. The atomistic positions are built on a by-residue basis following the geometrical reconstruction (internal coordinates) proposed by `Parsons et al. <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.20237>`_. Bond distances and angles are derived from rough organic chemistry considerations stored in backmapping libraries. Next, the structures from the initial stage are protonated and minimized with the atomistic force field ff14SB within the tleap module of AmberTools.  

.. important::
   
   By default, ``sirah_backmap`` minimizes the structures after the backmapping procedure. `AmberTools <http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php>`_ is used to accomplish the minimization task. Make sure AmberTools and the $AMBERHOME environment are set up properly. If you are using AmberTools via conda, AmberTools environment should be activated before opening VMD. 
   
   However, the ``nomin`` option can be used to disable the minimization step. Consequently, you can minimize backmapped outputs by utilizing other software/force fields outside of VMD. Keep in mind that hydrogen atoms won't be added to the structures if the minimization step is skipped.

With the ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` file loaded, you can access the ``sirah_help`` feature by going to *Extensions* > *Tk Console* and entering 

.. code-block:: console

   sirah_help 

to see all the SIRAH tools available options. Or, you can go straight to the help for the ``sirah_backmap`` feature by typing

.. code-block:: console

   sirah_backmap help

The output will be the following:

.. code-block:: console

      >>>> sirah_backmap <<<<

      version: 1.0 [Nov 2015]

      Description:

        Command to recover atomistic information from coarse-grained or multiscale
        systems.
        
        Geometric operations are applied to reconstruct the atomic coordinates then
        a minimization is performed to refine the structure of the system.
        The minimization requires AMBERTOOLS 14 (free at http://ambermd.org/)
        or later properly installed. MPI option requires mpirun and parallel
        compilation of AMBER code. Be aware that small systems may fail to run or
        converge in parallel execution due to decomposition problems. Notice, the
        cuda version requires installing the AMBER licensed suite.
        
        By default, the force field ff14SB is used for the atomistic refinement,
        any residue or unit not defined within it will generate an execution error.
        The minimization protocol consists on 100+50 steps of steepest descent and
        conjugate gradient in vacuum conditions with a 0.12 nm cut-off for
        electrostatic.

        The current command version does not support PBC options, so make sure the
        molecules are whole before running the backmap.
        
      Usage: sirah_backmap [options]

      Options: These are the optional arguments

        mol       Set the molecule ID, default top.

        now       Backmap the current frame.
        
        first     First frame to process.
        
        last      Last frame to process.
        
        each      Process frames each number of steps, default 1.

        frames    List of frames to process, e.g. {1 2 10 21 22 23 30}.
        
        outname   Root names for output PDB file.
        
        noload    Flag to avoid loading the atomistic trajectory to the VMD session.
        
        nomin     Flag to avoid minimizing the system.
        
        mpi       MPI processes to use during minimization, default 1.

        cuda      Flag to use pmemd.cuda, sets gbsa on, cutoff to 999 and no MPI.

        gbsa      Flag to use implicit solvation GBSA (igb=1), default off (igb=0).

        cutoff    Set cut-off value (in angstroms) for non-bonded interactions, default 12.

        maxcyc    Set total number of minimization steps, default 150.

        ncyc      Set the initial number of steepest descent steps, default 100.
        
        help      Display help and exit.

.. note::
   
	Currently, backmapping libraries contain instructions for solute (proteins, DNA, and metal ions).
	

All the available options for ``sirah_backmap`` are documented in this help. By default, all trajectory frames are used. Due to the fact that our protein-DNA complex is a 3.0 μs MD simulation with 30,000 frames, processing the entire trajectory could take some time. Thus, we chose to analyze the trajectory by extracting one frame every 1,000 frames with the ``each`` option. To do that you type:

.. code-block:: console

		sirah_backmap each 1000

The output is a 300-frame file named ``backmap.pdb``. This file is displayed as an animated GIF in **Figure 6**.

.. figure:: /../images/backmapping_bad.gif
   :align: center
   :width: 100%
    
   **Figure 6.** The 300-frame backmapped all-atom output from the 3.0 μs MD simulation using the default minimization arguments of ``sirah_backmap``. 

.. warning::

   Always check both the original CG trajectory and the backmapping output to identify out-of-the-ordinary behavior and adjust arguments accordingly. 

   Keep in mind that the minimized structures sometimes may differ from the CG trajectory due to the combination of all-atom minimization algorithms, number of cycles, cutoffs, etc.

   An example of this behavior is explained below.
	
	
The original atomistic PDB file shows that a few nucleotides at the DNA molecule's extremities are unpaired, allowing them to interact with neighboring molecules. Since we used this original PDB file to generate our CG representation, we anticipated that the unpaired nucleotides would exhibit a flexible behavior. However, in the backmapped PDB file, you can observe that the DNA extremities undergo unusual deformations and movements. These events are not observed in the CG simulation, as shown in **Figure 7**. 

.. figure:: /../images/CG.gif
   :align: center
   :width: 100%
   
   **Figure 7.** The same 300-frame trajectory from the 3.0 μs MD simulation in CG representation does not show the unreal behavior at the DNA extremities.

In most cases, the default parameters of 100 steps of steepest descent (``ncyc``) and 50 steps of conjugate gradient (total of 150 ``maxcyc`` steps) in vacuum conditions are sufficient to produce a correct result. However, in this instance, they produced artifactual conformations that were absent in the CG simulation. To solve this, you can modify the total minimization steps to 50 for ``maxcyc`` and to 25 for ``ncyc`` as follows:

.. caution::
	
	Return the original CG trajectory's **top** status in VMD prior to typing the command.

.. code-block:: console

		sirah_backmap each 1000 maxcyc 50 ncyc 25


The output is a new 300-frame file named ``backmap.pdb``, displayed as an animated GIF in **Figure 8**, exhibiting a similar behavior to the CG representation simulation.

.. figure:: /../images/backmapping_ok.gif
   :align: center
   :width: 100%
   
   **Figure 8.** The final 300-frame backmapped output from the 3.0 μs MD simulation using less minimization steps by modifying the ``maxcyc`` and ``ncyc`` arguments of ``sirah_backmap``.


It is important to try different combinations of settings to find the one that works best for your system. To keep the backmapped files, you can always change the output name with the ``outname`` option:

.. code-block:: console

		sirah_backmap each 1000 maxcyc 50 ncyc 25 outname backmap_less_min.pdb

If you need to perform non-interactive analysis on large trajectories or if a graphical user interface is not available, you can also execute the SIRAH Tools plugin using VMD text mode. When in text mode, VMD does not provide a window for graphical output, but many of its features are available. To launch VMD in text mode, the ``-dispdev text`` and ``-f`` flags are appended to the command line used before to load the trajectory, as shown below: 

.. code-block:: bash

    vmd -dispdev text -f ../5YWS_cg.psf 5YWS_cg_md_pbc.xtc -e ../sirah.ff/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl

The output will be similar to the following:
	
.. code-block:: console

	SIRAH radii were set

	SIRAH coloring mothods were set
	SIRAH Tool kit for VMD was loaded. Use sirah_help to access the User Manual pages
	vmd >

The final lines indicate that SIRAH Tools were loaded correctly. Thus, in the `vmd >` prompt, for instance, you can type ``sirah_help``:

.. code-block:: console
	
	vmd > sirah_help
	
In this mode, the ``sirah_ss`` and ``sirah_backmap`` features can also be utilized. For example, if you want to calculate the secondary structure for the protein (loaded on *top*) on all frames, you type:

.. code-block:: console
	
	vmd > sirah_ss sel "sirah_protein"
         0    25   50   75   100 %
	Progress |||||||||||||||||||||
	Starting sscache... Done!
	SUMMARY: <H> 36.8% <E> 16.2% <C> 47.1%

Additionally, you can construct customized scripts, that contain vmd commands, to load and process your trajectories with SIRAH Tools in VMD text mode. For example, you can create a ``sirah_dispdev.tcl`` file:

.. code-block:: console
	
	# vmd_commands.tcl
	mol new 5YWS_cg.psf
	mol addfile 5YWS_cg_md_pbc.xtc waitfor all
	source sirah.ff/tools/sirah_vmdtk.tcl
	sirah_ss
	sirah_backmap now nomin outname last_frame_backmap
	quit
	
This script will load the topology ``5YWS_cg.psf``, the trajectory ``5YWS_cg_md_pbc.xtc``, and ``sirah_vmdtk.tcl`` files. Then, process secondary structure with ``sirah_ss`` and create a backmapped pdb of the last frame with ``sirah_backmap`` with the name ``last_frame_backmap.pdb``. With the ``quit`` command, VMD is closed. To read the script, you type:

.. code-block:: bash

    vmd -dispdev text -e sirah_dispdev.tcl
